# Recoveriness

This repo contains codes for the paper [10.1175/JHM-D-23-0196.1](https://doi.org/10.1175/JHM-D-23-0196.1). We have used Quantile Random Forest to provide probabilistic estimates of flash flood recoveriness based on a comprehensive set of geomorphological and climatological predictors. The recession limb of the hydrograph was modeled to assess the recovery potential of watersheds after flash floods. The approach successfully identified key predictors and localized hotspots, providing valuable insights for disaster management and recovery planning.
